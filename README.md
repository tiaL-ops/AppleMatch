Ever dreamt of becoming the next Newton?

Well, today's your day! We're thrilled to introduce an app that will guide you to the secret locations where some of the biggest ideas of all time originated... apple trees.

> It's scientifically proven that a falling apple to the head sparks genius!

AppleMatch helps you find the perfect apple tree near you.

Swipe to discover trees that match your preferences: girth, length, ageâ€”we've got you covered. Swipe and let our magic work, boosting your chances of becoming a genius to 120%!

## Core Features

1.  **Map View**: See all the apple trees around you, complete with important data (age, girth, IQ, etc.).
2.  **View and Swipe Profile**: ;)
3.  **Favorites**: Save your favorite apple trees, just like some parents have a favorite child.
4.  **Mock Tree Dataset**: We've faked the data, much like we fake social media.

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Set up your development team in Signing & Capabilities
3. Trust the developer certificate on your device

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

**Flutter framework codesigning errors**: Try building directly in Xcode first, then use `flutter run`
